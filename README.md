# 🌍 WanderMind – A Mood-Based Travel Companion Powered by Agents

**WanderMind** is the result of our very first hackathon — and our very first experience building with agents 🤯. None of us had ever built an autonomous system like this before. We had to dive deep, learn fast, and constantly adapt. It was a real challenge — but also an amazing opportunity 💪.

## 🎯 The Idea

When you're feeling **sad**, **stressed**, **adventurous**, or **full of energy**, you don’t want a generic trip ✈️. You want something that *feels right* for your mood.

So we built **WanderMind**, a conversational agent that:
1. Asks you for your **mood**, **departure city**, and **travel week** 🗓️  
2. Thinks step by step:
   - Reflects on your mood
   - Determines what you emotionally need
   - Picks a destination and matching activity
   - Checks weather and safety
   - Finds flights via the Skyscanner API
   - Wraps it all up in an inspiring travel plan 💌  
3. Loops back if something’s wrong (e.g. it's going to rain 🌧️)

## 🔧 How It Works

We learned how to:
- Register and call tools 🛠️
- Construct **planning loops**
- Create structured **multi-step prompts**
- Design a system that acts, rather than reacts

Despite being beginners, we really tried to understand how agents **think**, **reason**, and **execute** autonomously.

## 🚧 What Still Needs Work

This is just the beginning 🚀:
- Some tools still fail occasionally
- Flight results can be incomplete
- The agent sometimes doesn’t detect missing or invalid inputs

But we’re already planning improvements — better input validation, richer mood analysis, and more creative travel suggestions 🧳.

## ❤️ Why We Built It

We didn’t want to just build a fancy prompt. We wanted to **explore the fundamentals of agents**: planning, memory, tools, and autonomy. Even if it might look like something ChatGPT could do — it’s not! It’s a structured, step-by-step agent with internal logic and decision-making.

## 🙏 Thanks

Thanks for checking out our project!  
**WanderMind** isn’t perfect — but it’s full of potential. We’re proud of what we’ve learned, and excited to keep exploring the world of agents 🧠❤️
